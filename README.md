UXPilot is a powerful AI-powered web application designed specifically for UI/UX designers to help them move from idea to structured design faster and more ethically. 
Unlike existing competitors like QoQo, UXPilot includes unique features that promote ethical design thinking, 
user journey planning, reusable UI systems, and AI-powered feedback on design accessibility and consistency. The application allows designers to enter a simple prompt, 
which the AI then transforms into visual ideas like low-fidelity wireframes or component suggestions, all displayed on an interactive canvas.
Designers can also build user journey maps dynamically based on different personas and user goals.
A standout feature is the Dark Pattern Detector, which analyzes design flows and alerts the designer if a potentially manipulative 
or unethical UX pattern is being usedâ€”something no major competitor currently offers. 
UXPilot also allows users to upload existing design images or Figma links to receive instant AI-generated feedback on accessibility, 
layout, and usability based on UX best practices. To support learning, it includes a Design Principle Generator that recommends relevant UX laws and principles based 
on the userâ€™s project type, making it perfect for both beginners and seasoned designers. For better organization, every user prompt and result should be saved locally 
or in the cloud , and users can revisit or export them to PDF, Notion, or Figma. The interface should be sleek, modern, and built with a clean, dark-themed animated 
landing page where users can read about the features, watch demos, and even sign up for early access using google or gitshub accounts. 
The app should use a freemium model: free users can generate prompts, view canvas results, and create basic journey maps.
Pro users (who pay manually via bank transfer and unlock premium features with a reference code) 
should access the full suiteâ€”including AI feedback, ethical analysis, export options, and advanced toolkits.
This web app should be built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the frontend, Node.js with Express for the backend, 
and OpenAI APIs for the AI engine. You can also use Fabric.js or Konva.js to handle the canvas feature and localStorage or IndexedDB for prompt history and offline saving.
