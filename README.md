## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or higher recommended)
-   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
-   [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) installed and running.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd UXPILOT-APP
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add the following variables. Replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials.

    ```env
    # Server Configuration
    PORT=3000
    NODE_ENV=development
    FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000

    # Database
    MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/uxpilot

    # Session
    SESSION_SECRET=your_super_secret_session_key

    # OpenAI API
    OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

    # Stripe Payments
    STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

    # Google OAuth
    GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id.apps.googleusercontent.com
    GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret

    # GitHub OAuth
    GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your_github_client_id
    GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your_github_client_secret
    ```

### Running the Application

The development environment requires running the backend server and the TailwindCSS compiler in separate terminals.

1.  **Start the backend server:**
    This command starts the server with `nodemon`, which automatically restarts on file changes.
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```

2.  **Start the TailwindCSS compiler:**
    This command watches for CSS changes and rebuilds the output file.
    ```sh
    npm run build:css
    ```

The application should now be running at the `FRONTEND_URL` you configured (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).

## API Endpoints

The server exposes several RESTful API endpoints under the `/api` prefix:

-   **/auth**: Handles user registration, login, and OAuth (Google, GitHub).
-   **/ai**: Powers AI features like content generation and design feedback.
-   **/user**: Manages user profiles and data.
-   **/payment**: Integrates with Stripe for creating checkout sessions.
-   **/design**: Manages user designs and projects.
-   **/team**: Handles team collaboration features.
-   **/codegen**: Provides code generation capabilities.
-   **/analytics**: Tracks usage and performance metrics.
